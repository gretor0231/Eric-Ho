Hi, my name is Cheng En Ho (Eric Ho). I am a Computer Science master student at the University of New Mexico. I have worked as a hardware engineer at ASUS company and BISO engineer at AMI company. Now I am a full time student at UNM.




I have hide the "sensitive code": specifically CS544 (Intro to Cybersecurity UNM), because it has some attack scrver scripts, feel free to contact me at gretor0231@gmail.com
